<h2>Why did I choose this theme?</h2>

<p>Other assignments:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="week3lab2.html">Week 3</a></li>
    <li><a href="week4lab3.html">Week 4</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to make the theme of my first Web page is IS-40 all about my dog, 
because she's so cute and because Dr. C. must have suggested my dog as a them 
at least 5 times during the course of the extended introduction and orientation
video.
</p>

<h2>What kind of dog is it?</h2>

<p>My dog is a toy poodle. She is apricot brown, and so that's why we called
her Tao, which is the Chinese word for peach.
</p>

<h2>What it's like living with a toy poodle</h2>

<p>Poodles don't shed. That's one of their greatest attributes. Their hair 
grows like a human's hair. It gets long and unkempt. This means it is very
important that they regularly visit the groomer. During the summer, our dog
Tao visits the groomer every week. During the winter, she likes to wear her
hair a little longer for the warmth. So she gets a little scruffy. When her 
hair grows out long on her face, it makes her look like a puppy.
</p>

<p>This little poodle is quite the princess. She knows very well how to get what
she wants. I was reminded of her today when I read an article on the blog of the
Scientific American web site titled 
<a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2012/04/30/dogs-but-not-wolves-use-humans-as-tools/">"Dogs, But Not Wolves, Use Humans as Tools."</a>
In the article, the scientists do a study which showed that there is a genetic 
difference between domesticated dogs and wolves that have been raised by humans, which
explains differences in their behavior. Even though the wolves are tame, they 
are merely habituated to humans. The domesticated dog has gradually changed over
the last fifteen to thirty thousand years so that now they are genetically
programmed to depend on humans. Their tests showed that dogs will make eye contact
with humans in order to solicit their help to reach food. The wolf pups never learned
that one simple trick. Our dog Tao has definitely learned this trick, and is never
hesitant to employ me to do her bidding.
</p>

<h2>Benefits of having a dog</h2>
<p>Lest I lead you to believe that life with Tao is endless drudgery and servitude,
I should take a moment here to let you know that there are benefits to sharing
your life with a pet dog. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4625213/ns/health-pet_health/t/puppy-love----its-better-you-think/">
An article by Jane Weaver in Pet Health on NBCNews.com dated 4/8/2004</a> claims 
that time with your dog will release hormones such as seratonin, prolactin, and 
oxytocin. Snuggling with your pup actually makes you feel good--
no anti-depressants needed.
