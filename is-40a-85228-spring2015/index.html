<h1>All about the cute dog</h1>

<h2>Why did I choose this theme?</h2>

<p>I decided to make the theme of my first Web page is IS-40 all about my dog, 
because she's so cute and because Dr. C. must have suggested my dog as a them 
at least 5 times during the course of the extended introduction and orientation
video.
</p>

<h2>What kind of dog is it?</h2>

<p>My dog is a teacup poodle. She is apricot brown, and so that's why we called
her Tao, which is the Chinese word for peach.
