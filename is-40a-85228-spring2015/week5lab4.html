    <p>Click on Judas Iscariot, unlucky number 13 (fourth from the left) 
    to read the story of betrayal. It's one theory why the number 13 is
    perceived as unlucky in Western superstition.</p>

    <p>This week, the due date for our assignment is Friday the
    13th. I was curious about why this date is considered "bad
    luck" in Western countries, so I Googled it. The most
    interesting result I found was the <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th">Wikipedia
    article</a> which featured a photograph of Leonardo da Vinci's
    mural painting of The Last Supper, a prominent story in the
    Christian mythology. Friday the 13th itself turned out to not
    be very interesting. It's a recent idea, not mentioned in
    writing before the 19th century and not gaining popularity
    until the 20th century, according to the Wikipedia article
    linked to above. But its link to the mural painting is
    interesting.</p>

    <p>Did you know that, according to U.S. copyright law (at
    least, according to the <a href=
    "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing#Material_in_the_public_domain">
    Licensing Discussion on Wikimedia Commons</a>), photographs of
    artwork in the public domain are also in the public domain?
    This means that I can use this fantastic art on my web page, as
    I have done above. Source attribution is recommended by
    Wikipedia, and mandatory for academic rigour, so I have linked
    to the page where you can read all about this image on
    Wikipedia.</p>

    <p>Usually, hot-linking is a very frowned-upon and ethically
    questionable practice whereby a web page will contain an image
    whose source is not local but contained on another Web server.
    However, there are exceptions to this rule. One was pointed out
    to us by Dr. C. in his introductory lecture at the beginning of
    the semester; he told us that some web sites that host photos
    provide mechanisms for their customers to embed the image,
    hosted on the photo-sharing web site, in their own page or
    another page elsewhere on the web.</p>

    <p>I found a second exception tonight: Hot-linking images from
    Wikipedia is permitted, providing appropriate attribution is
    given to the source, and with the proviso that it is not
    generally a good idea. It's not a good idea because Wikipedia
    is a dynamic web site, edited by many different authors and
    subject to change at any time. Some of that change may be
    deliberate malicious vandalism, and so you may end up serving a
    page on your web site showing an image you most certainly did
    not intend. Nevertheless, the image above is hot-linked from
    the Wikipedia site.</p>
    
    <p>Back to the topic at hand. While Friday the 13th is a relatively
    modern phenomenon, the Wikipedia article tells us that Friday 
    has been an unlucky day to undertake journeys or begin new projects
    since at least the 14th Century. Wikipedia's source for this
    claim is Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Obligingly, Wikipedia offers
    a link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales">
    The Canterbury Tales</a>, which in turn links us to the Wikipedia
    page on Chaucer himself.</p>
