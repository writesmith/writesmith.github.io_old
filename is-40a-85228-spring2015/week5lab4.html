    <p>This week, the due date for our assignment is Friday the 13th. I was 
    curious about why this date is considered "bad luck" in Western countries, so
    I Googled it. The most interesting result I found was the 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th">Wikipedia article</a>
    which featured a photograph of Leonardo da Vinci's mural painting of The
    Last Supper, a prominent story in the Christian mythology. Friday the 13th
    itself turned out to not be very interesting. It's a recent idea, not 
    mentioned in writing before the 19th century and not gaining popularity until
    the 20th century, according to the Wikipedia article linked to above. But
    it's link to the mural painting is interesting.</p>
    <p>Did you know that, according to U.S. copyright law (at least, according 
    to the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing#Material_in_the_public_domain">
        Licensing Discussion on Wikimedia Commons</a>), photographs of
    artwork in the public domain are also in the public domain? This means that
    I can use this fantastic art on my web page, as I have done above. Source
    attribution is recommended by Wikipedia, and mandatory for academic rigour,
    so I have linked to the page where you can read all about this image on 
    Wikipedia.</p>
    <p>Usually, hot-linking is a very frowned-upon and ethically questionable
    practice whereby a web page will contain an image whose source is not local
    but contained on another Web server. However, there are exceptions to this
    rule. One was pointed out to us by Dr. C. in his introductory lecture at the
    beginning of the semester; he told us that some web sites that host photos
    provide mechanisms for their customers to embed the image, hosted on the
    photo-sharing web site, in their own page or another page elsewhere on the
    web.</p>
    <p>I found a second exception tonight: Hot-linking images from Wikipedia is
    permitted, providing appropriate attribution is given to the source, and
    with the proviso that it is not generally a good idea. It's not a good idea
    because Wikipedia is a dynamic web site, edited by many different authors
    and subject to change at any time. Some of that change may be deliberate
    malicious vandalism, and so you may end up serving a page on your web site
    showing an image you most certainly did not intend. Nevertheless, the image
    above is hot-linked from the Wikipedia site.</p>
