    <h1>All About my Favorite Food</h1>
    <p><img class="im-fl" src="../images/pannekoek/1cooking.jpg" alt="Pancakes cooking on the stove" width="640" height="480">Food is more than something to eat. It is deeply cultural, meaningful, steeped in context. Here is something I like to make on weekend mornings once in a while. It's a quiet time of introspections, colored by scenes half-remembered from my childhood. The morning is quiet, and nobody else is up. Sunlight is streaming in the east-facing kitchen window, and my coffee is made. It's time to prepare pancakes.</p>
    <p><img class="im-fl" src="../images/pannekoek/website.jpg" alt="recipe" width="640" height="480">The recipe is a simple one, with just a few ingredients. The ingredients are staples that could be found in any farmhouse pantry. A cup of flour. Two eggs. Three-quarters of a cup of water and a cup of milk. Half a teaspoon of salt. Mix it all together into a runny batter and put it into the fridge. Have some more coffee and listen to the house start to wake up.</p>
