<p>I spent a lot of time this week trying to figure out how to lay out a 
page using CSS. The look I was going for is to have a large image fill the
browser window so that a page visitor gets a big, bold picture to look at.
Then, after the visitor scrolls down, the content is revealed. I spent so
much time reading CSS tutorials, searching Google and StackOverflow, that
I started to run out of time. I had some interesting leads on new content
for this weeks page, but in the eleventh hour, while desperately trying to
get my header text to appear on top of my header image (while at the same
time getting all my other text to flow naturally below the image) I 
temporarily linked to an existing image. I picked one at random. It was a 
picture of a rolled pancake. Over and over I edited the stylesheet, then
switched to the browser and refreshed the page. Over and over the image of
the rolled pancake presented itself to me. The image soaked into my 
conciousness. It occupied my thoughts. It made me hungry. I thought about
pancakes as I scrolled through search results. Cinnamon spiced the tutorials
as I was disappointed again and again, repeatedly failing to achieve the
effect I wanted.</p>
<p>When I finally figured it out is was an epiphany. A moment of euphoria soaked in dissolved sugar. It was delicious on my tongue. I sat and looked at the white letters written on top of the image of the pancake. I sat and looked at the pancake. I slowly realized that I was already looking at the right image. Instead of changing the image to reflect a new theme for the week, I changed the text to refer to the pancake. The buddhists have this concept of "right livelihood", meaning there is some way that is right for you to earn your livelihood, and if you search earnestly enough and wait patiently enough, it will come to you and you will be satisfied. This week I'm practicing "right themehood" and with enough patience and waiting, the pancakes will come to me and I will be satisfied.</p>
